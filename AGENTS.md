# AGENTS.md

This repository is a documentation-only guidebook for OpenAI Codex CLI.

## Working Agreement For Changes

- Prefer editing Markdown under `docs/`.
- Keep lists single-level (no nested bullets). If you need hierarchy, split into multiple lists or sections.
- When documenting a command, include: what it is for; a minimal example; and any safety footnotes (sandbox, approvals, network).
- Prefer official OpenAI Codex docs (developers.openai.com) for factual claims. When you add new claims, add/update citations in `docs/references.md`.
- Add or update `Last verified: YYYY-MM-DD` near the top of any page you substantially change.
- Avoid pasting large logs. Summarize and include the command used to obtain them.

## Repo Intent

- No code generation is expected here.
- Do not add `.codex/config.toml` to this repo. If you want to show example config, include it in Markdown code blocks instead.
